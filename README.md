================

Basic tutorial on CodeSchool

Codeschool is awesome, but personally I think it's always useful test locally when learning a new framework.


Notes:
1). Go to the http://emberjs.com/ and download the starter kit.
2). Make sure ember inspector for chrome is installed https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ember-inspector
3). The inspector may not work if you load it as a file. To be safe set a simple http server to run locally.
    - Example: python -m SimpleHTTPServer (if python is installed)
4). NOW start building your project along side the tutorial  :)

* Attention *
Around level 4 you will need to include "ember-data.js" and start refactoring your routes. This can be difficult...
